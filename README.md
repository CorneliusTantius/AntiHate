# Important Notes!!
  * This is windows specific GUI app. (linux or mac os can still run it using shell `python` or `python3` command)
  * ### Make sure you have `64 bit python`! unless it won't work
  * You can do a complete python uninstall and run the `inst-req.bat` too, it will install python for you, ALSO REMEMBER that your current pip packages will be lost
  * run `inst-req.bat` to prepare the requirements.
  * if you already own python makesure to use `Python version 3.7` (higher version may cause errors).
